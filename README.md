# Autistic-Patients-EDA-and-ANN-Classification-Model

# Overview

- An Artificial Neural Network project dedicated to Classify Autistic Patients from Non Autistic Patients (Predict the likelihood of a person having autism using survey and demographic variables.)

- The project highlightsthe significance of Data Cleaning (Preprocessing) ,Data Exploration (Descriptive Statistics) , and employs professional visualizations to enhance data understanding.
